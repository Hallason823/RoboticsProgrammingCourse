# Robotics Programming – Mechanical Engineering (UFPE) – 2023.1

This repository contains projects and materials developed for the **Robotics Programming** course in the **Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering** program at the **Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)**, during the **2023.1** academic semester.

The course focused on the fundamentals of **robotic programming using Python**, emphasizing **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and the use of the **Robot Operating System (ROS)** to control and simulate robotic systems.

## Course Topics

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python  
- Introduction to ROS (Robot Operating System)  
  - ROS nodes, publishers, subscribers  
  - Topics, messages, and services  
  - Launch files and simulation environments  
- Integration of Python with ROS nodes  
- Real-time control of robotic systems  
- Sensor data processing and feedback control  
- Modular code design for robotic applications  
- Debugging tools and ROS command-line interface  
- Basic use of simulation tools (e.g., Gazebo or similar)

## Real-World Challenge

One of the key highlights of the course was a **hands-on project** where students programmed a **real mobile robotic car**, applying OOP principles and ROS communication architecture. This practical experience helped consolidate theoretical knowledge through a realistic challenge involving navigation, sensor integration, and task automation.
